We have tweaked the Exportify project for our own (very specific) use case. The result is aimed at a very specific group of users. 

Export your Spotify playlists to [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) by clicking on the link below:

[https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/)

This application provides a simple interface for using the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

**No data will be saved - the entire application runs in the browser.**


## Usage

1. Fire up [the app](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/)
2. Click 'Get Started'
3. Grant Exportify read-only access to your playlists
4. Click the 'Export' button to export a playlist

Click 'Export All' to save a zip file containing a CSV file for each playlist in your account. This may take a while when many playlists exist and/or they are large.
